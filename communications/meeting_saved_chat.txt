11:40:16	 From Joshua Mailman to Chris Chan (Direct Message) : Here’s what I ended up with:
11:40:18	 From Joshua Mailman to Chris Chan (Direct Message) : for i in range(1, 101):
    s = ""
    if i % 3 == 0:
        s += "Fizz"
    if i % 5 == 0:
        s += "Buzz"
    if s =="":
        s=i
    print(s)

11:41:24	 From Chris Chan to Joshua Mailman (Direct Message) : Does that mean “I” is now a string?
